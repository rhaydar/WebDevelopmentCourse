CodeShare.io practices:
-2017-05-18
	Q1) Write a method that returns the first non-repeated character in a string.
	Q2) Write a method that returns true if two strings are the same, false otherwise. You cannot use the .equals() method of the String class.

-2017-05-22
	Q1) Write a function that checks to see if a string
	is a palindrome, a word (or phrase) that is the same
	spelled forwards and backwards. If the string is a 
	palindrome, then the function should return true, 
	false otherwise.

	Q2) Write a function that takes two strings, and checks to see if one is an anagram of the other. An anagram has the same characters, the same number of times. Examples:
	"listen" and "silent", "admirer" and "married". If the two strings are anagrams, then return true, otherwise return false.
