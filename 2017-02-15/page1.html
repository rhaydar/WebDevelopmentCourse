		  <h3>Frankenstein: <i>or, The Modern Prometheus</i></h3>

			<p>I had seen the movie as a little kid and remembered being scared out of my wits. But I had not actually read the book and decided to give it a try. Loved it! For a book that was written nearly 2-- years ago, I was surprised at how easy it was to read.</p>

			<p>It's interesting that everyone refers to the monster as Frankenstein, but it was actually the doctor's name. Also, I was surprised at how much I cared about the monster and what would happen to him. I recommend that everyone read this classic book written by Mary Shelley!</p>
